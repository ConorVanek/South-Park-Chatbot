# South-Park-Chatbot
A Python Chatbot using the Chatterbot module &amp; its dependencies... trained using South Park Scripts.

For a period of time I was curious about Machine Learning and I wanted to use it in a small project... Luckily Python has tools such as Tensorflow that do all the heavy lifting for you. I decided to make a chat bot that will accept string input and calculate a response. To add a funny twist to the project I chose to train it with the scripts to the first 16 seasons of South Park. Some of the responses are quite funny (and yes, a bit off-color) and some of them don't quite make sense, but it was still an interesting and amusing project.

**Obviously you need to have python installed and an environment set up with all the necessary libraries to run this (Chatterbot and all its dependencies). I highly recommend [Anaconda Navigator](https://www.anaconda.com) for easy and user-friendly python development and environment management**
